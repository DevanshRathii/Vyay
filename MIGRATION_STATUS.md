# Migration Status

> Living handover doc for the SQLite → Vercel + Supabase migration.
> Updated after every completed sub-task. Full plan: `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`.
> Resume prompt for a fresh session: *"Continue the Vyay migration. Read MIGRATION_PLAN.md and MIGRATION_STATUS.md, then pick up at the first unchecked item."*

## Done

- **Pre-migration integrations** (previous sessions): git repo pushed to
  https://github.com/DevanshRathii/Vyay (branch `main`); Vercel CLI authed,
  project `devansh-s-team/vyay` linked to the GitHub repo (one stray
  auto-triggered production deployment exists — expected to fail, ignore or
  delete); Supabase CLI authed.
- **Phase 0**: plan approved and persisted as `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`; this
  status file created. Committed together.
- **Phase 1**: Supabase re-provisioned. User deleted the Seoul project and
  created **`llciwbpnlmlroromfdoc`** ("Vyay", `ap-south-1`, Postgres 17,
  ACTIVE_HEALTHY); agent linked it via `supabase link`.
  - OUTSTANDING USER ACTION (non-blocking until first migration run): add
    `DATABASE_URL` (transaction pooler, port 6543) and
    `MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL` (direct, port 5432) to local `.env`, copied from
    dashboard → Connect. Direct host: `db.llciwbpnlmlroromfdoc.supabase.co`.

- **Phase 2**: complete. schema.ts on pg-core (epoch-ms as
  `bigint mode:"number"`, `initialSyncDone` boolean, `confidence`
  doublePrecision, `amountPaise` bigint for large transfers);
  drizzle.config → postgresql (`MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL`); fresh pg migration
  `drizzle/0000_overrated_captain_flint.sql` (sqlite migrations deleted, in
  git history); `db/index.ts` on postgres.js (`max:1, prepare:false` —
  pooler requirement); standalone `migrate.ts` (tsx + process.loadEnvFile,
  direct connection); PGlite test harness (`tests/helpers/pglite.ts`) and
  all 4 DB-backed test files converted to async/await; deps swapped
  (better-sqlite3 removed; postgres, @vercel/functions, @electric-sql/pglite
  added); `.env.example` updated (DATABASE_URL/MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL/
  CRON_SECRET; DATABASE_PATH gone).
  - **Plan correction (honest state):** whole-program typecheck is RED and
    stays red until Phase 3 finishes — the 81 legacy `.get()/.all()/.run()`
    call sites don't exist on pg query types. This was foreseen but
    mis-stated in the plan ("typecheck as Phase 2 gate"); real gates were:
    schema compiles in isolation, migration generates, deps install.

- **Phase 3: complete.** All 81 originally-counted sync call sites
  converted (batches A–D: core lib, gmail path, API routes, auth.ts +
  seed.ts), plus one site the original grep missed —
  `src/app/api/contacts/import/route.ts` called `importContactsFromVCard()`
  without awaiting it (that function has no direct `.get/.all/.run` call
  itself, so it wasn't in the original 81-count; caught by `tsc`, not the
  grep). Conversion conventions used everywhere: `.all()` → `await q`;
  `.get()` → `(await q.limit(1))[0]`; `.run()` → `await q`; better-sqlite3
  `res.changes === 0` checks → `.returning({id}).length === 0` (works on
  both postgres.js and PGlite); `initialSyncDone` writes now use booleans.
  - **Green gates all pass**: `npm run typecheck` clean; `npm run test` —
    68/68 passing on the first-ever PGlite run, no driver quirks, no fixes
    needed in `tests/helpers/pglite.ts`; `npm run lint` clean.

## In progress

- Nothing mid-flight. Repo is fully green on Postgres/postgres.js/PGlite.

## Next

- **Phase 4 — Google-only auth + tenant-isolation audit**
  (`MIGRATION_PLAN.md` §Phase 4): remove credentials provider from
  `auth.ts`, delete `/register` page + `/api/register`, strip password
  fields from the login form; fix the known cross-tenant bug (`unseenIds()`
  in `sync.ts` missing a `userId` filter — deliberately left unfixed until
  now); systematic audit of every query for a userId predicate; add a
  tenant-isolation regression test.
- User-side prerequisite still outstanding (needed before the first
  `npx tsx migrate.ts` run, not before Phase 4): `DATABASE_URL` +
  `MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL` in local `.env` — **done**, both are set in
  `.env` as of this session.
- **Vercel Git auto-deploy is DISCONNECTED** (`vercel git disconnect`,
  2026-07-09) — every mid-migration push was triggering a doomed production
  build + failure email. **Phase 7 must run `vercel git connect` after the
  first successful manual deploy.**

## Decisions log

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sign-in | Google-only, drop email+password | One identity path; every user needs Google for Gmail anyway; less surface |
| Prod data | Fresh start, no SQLite port | Re-sync from Gmail rebuilds history; local SQLite stays as dev DB |
| DB region | Recreate in ap-south-1 (Mumbai) | User base in India; project was accidentally created in Seoul |
| Timestamps | Keep bigint epoch-ms | Explicit user constraint — do not refactor to native timestamps |
| `initialSyncDone` | Convert to native boolean | User-specified |
| Runtime driver | postgres.js, `max: 1`, `prepare: false` | Serverless requirement; Supavisor transaction pooler breaks prepared statements |
| Test DB | PGlite in-process Postgres | Postgres has no in-memory mode; PGlite runs the same generated pg migration SQL |
| Sync lock/progress | DB columns, not in-memory Maps | Maps don't survive across serverless instances |
| Cron | Once daily, oldest-lastSyncAt-first, ~250s cutoff | Vercel Hobby limit; no user starves; initial syncs happen interactively via waitUntil |

## Known bugs to fix during migration (found in planning)

- `unseenIds()` in `src/lib/gmail/sync.ts` doesn't filter by `userId` —
  cross-tenant dedup bug (Phase 4).
- `POST /api/gmail/sync` fire-and-forgets `syncUser()` — dies on serverless
  without `waitUntil()` (Phase 5).
- `instrumentation-node.ts` setInterval loop must be gated off on Vercel
  (Phase 5).
